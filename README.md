# Band website

## 💼 Project Overview:

**Band website** is a music band "Грим та Грім" page, for tracking tours,
ordering tickets, getting to know the band members, and providing feedback and
suggestions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack:

- **HTML** - the basis of a web page structure that allows you to create
  semantic blocks, shape content, and maintain accessibility

- **CSS Modules** — a method of organizing styles that provides local scope for
  classes, preventing conflicts and making code maintenance more convenient and
  predictable

- **JavaScript** - a programming language for dynamically updating content,
  handling events, and interacting with the user, which adds functionality and
  interactivity to web applications
